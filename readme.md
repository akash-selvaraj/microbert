Welcome to MicroBert! This project consists of both a backend and frontend for the MicroBert application.

## Getting Started

### Backend

To start the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `microbert_backend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd microbert_backend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies (assuming you have Python and pip installed):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Start the Uvicorn server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
    ```

### Frontend

To start the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `microbert_frontend` folder:
    ```bash
    cd microbert_frontend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies (assuming you have Node.js and npm installed):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the Next.js frontend:
